# STEP 2: RAG SYSTEM ENGINE — rag_system.py
# ============================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   This is the BRAIN of MedAgentixAI. It implements the full
#   RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline:
#   
#   1. RETRIEVE: Find the most relevant knowledge chunks for a question
#   2. AUGMENT:  Combine the question + retrieved chunks into a prompt
#   3. GENERATE: Use Google Gemini AI to generate a medical answer
#
# WHAT IS RAG? (Detailed Explanation)
# =========================================
#   RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation
#   
#   Traditional AI (like ChatGPT) answers from its training data,
#   which can be outdated or hallucinate (make things up).
#   
#   RAG solves this by:
#   1. FIRST searching a knowledge base for relevant information
#   2. THEN feeding that information to an AI to generate an answer
#   
#   This means the AI always has REAL facts to work with, reducing
#   hallucination and ensuring accurate, source-backed answers.
#
# RAG PIPELINE IN THIS FILE:
#   User Question → TF-IDF Vectorize → Cosine Similarity Search →
#   Top-K Chunks Retrieved → Build Augmented Prompt → Gemini AI →
#   Final Answer with Sources

        STEP 2.4: RETRIEVAL — The "R" in RAG.
        
        This is the SEARCH ENGINE of our RAG system. Given a user's question,
        it finds the top-K most relevant knowledge chunks using cosine similarity.
        
        HOW COSINE SIMILARITY WORKS:
        ============================
        Imagine two arrows (vectors) in space:
        - If they point in the SAME direction → similarity = 1.0 (identical meaning)
        - If they are PERPENDICULAR → similarity = 0.0 (unrelated)
        - If they point in OPPOSITE directions → similarity = -1.0 (opposite meaning)
        
        We convert both the question AND each chunk into TF-IDF vectors,
        then calculate the cosine of the angle between them.
        
        EXAMPLE:
        ========
        Question: "What are cardiac diseases?"
        Chunk 1: "Cardiac Syndrome 11 affects cardiovascular systems..." → similarity: 0.82
        Chunk 2: "Respiratory Syndrome 5 affects breathing systems..."   → similarity: 0.15
        → Chunk 1 is much more relevant!

            category_filter:  Optional filter by disease category (e.g., "Cardiovascular")
            severity_filter:  Optional filter by severity level (e.g., "High")
